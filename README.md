## Flask app

### Run the application 

In order to run the python file, we need first to specify Flask where should find the application.

```commandline
export FLASK_APP=hello
```

As we are running the application locally we need to specify to Flask also that should run it in development mode. 

```commandline
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

To finally run it, we execute the following command 

```commandline
flask run
```

### Test the application
